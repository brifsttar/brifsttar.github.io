title: Driving Simulator in the making

At [Universit√© Gustave Eiffel](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/en/), more precisely at [LESCOT](https://lescot.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/en/), have a wide range of driving simulators to study driver behaviour. Our simulators range from simple desktop computers to full-scale immersive CAVE.

Working in a research lab implies we're always pushing the boundaries of what can be done with simulators, to ensure that our research stays ahead of the curve. This has consequences both in our hardware and software, for which we can't simply rely on commercial solutions, which often don't have the flexibility necessary to answer emerging needs.

Therefore, we're making our own simulation software, with the following goals in mind:
* State of the art visual quality for optimal immersion
* Accessible scene and scenario authoring tools, so that researchers can easily build their experiment exactly as they want
* Compatible with all our hardware, with easy deployment solution

In this blog, we'll discuss the various steps, challenges and solutions we put in place to reach our goals.
