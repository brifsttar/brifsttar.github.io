title: Making a scene
---
When you start implementing your experiment, the first thing you'll work on is the scene. You may want to reuse an existing one from a previous project, maybe modify it, or start from scratch to build something tailored to your needs.

In this article, we'll explain how we built the scene from the above screenshot, starting from nothing.

#Â Road network

As we [previously mentionned](/opendrive), the road network is a very important piece of our simulation, for which we need both the 3D representation and its logicial description (i.e. OpenDRIVE). As such, we've mentioned that we use [RoadRunner](https://www.mathworks.com/products/roadrunner.html), which is our favorite tool for that specific work.
