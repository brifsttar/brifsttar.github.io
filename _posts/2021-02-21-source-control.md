title: Source control
---
As a software engineer, source control is mandatory for any project I work with. A driving simulation platform, or experiment, is no exception. However, such projects have quite a few differences from traditional software. In this post, we'll explain the challenges we faced regarding source control, and how we answered (or failed to) them.

# Requirements

Assets
marketplace
forks
ease of use

# Which tool?

# Which provider?

# In practice: the bad

Plugin + submodules :(
Gitlab: MR on forks :(
Plugin is sloooooow
Diffing BP is meh
Merging BP is :'(
Working with binary is :'(
LFS lock with branches/forks?

Really hope for something from Epic in the near future.
