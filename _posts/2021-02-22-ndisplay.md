[nDisplay](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/WorkingWithMedia/nDisplay/index.html) is Unreal Engine's tool for [CAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment) and other cluster rendering, allowing simulation to be displayed on any amount of screens from any amount of computers. However, getting nDisplay to work for *driving* simulation can be challenging.

# Non-deterministic physics

One of the first hurdle I encountered with nDisplay was when I noticed that as time went by during the simulation, cars' position's would start to diverge from one screen to the next. In the first seconds, it would be near invisible, but after a few minutes, some cars could be at totally different places on each monitor.

This is caused by [PhysX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/physx/guide/Manual/Vehicles.html)'s non-deterministic model. Behind the scenes, nDisplay synchronizes all instances' clocks, and each instance then "solves" the simulation for that given time. But if the physics model is non-deterministic, you can then have two instances having very slight differences in their outputs, placing cars at very slightly different positions. Over the course of a whole scenario, this can lead to drastic differences.

As I'm writing this (4.26), [Chaos](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Physics/ChaosPhysics/Overview/index.html) is still experimental and not part of the official release. But this new physics engine might solve this issue by itself, as it seems Epic Games added a deterministic mode for nDisplay use cases.

Our workaround is to disable car's physics on all cluster slave, having only the master solving their position, which is sync'd with slaves using [Actor Replication](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/WorkingWithMedia/nDisplay/Replication/index.html).
